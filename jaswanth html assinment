<p>Cricket is a very interesting and engaging outdoor game. It is known as the gentlemanâ€™s game and is enjoyed all over the world.<br/> It creates a sense of discipline, team-spirit, fellow-feelings, and the spirit of sportsmanship among the players</p>
<p>. Played between two teams of 11 members on each side, the game starts with a toss to decide the batting and the bowling team.<br/> The match between our school and the rival team was very exciting.Our team won the toss and our captain elected to bat first.<br/> Our team played and scored 180 in 20 overs. It was a good inning and amazing to watch.</p>
